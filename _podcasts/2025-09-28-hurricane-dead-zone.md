title: "Hurricane Dead-Zone"
description: The Blufftonâ€“Savannah "dead-zone," a period of few hurricane landfalls since 1979, is attributed to prevailing steering patterns like the Bermuda High and statistical chance, but historical records confirm prior catastrophic strikes, and the concave Georgia Bight actually amplifies the risk of extreme storm surge.
