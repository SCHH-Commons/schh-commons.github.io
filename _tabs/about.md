## Making Sun City Information Easier to Find and Use

When I first arrived in Sun City, I was surprised by how hard it could be to find certain kinds of information. Important details are scattered across many places—the Sun City website (both public and resident-only pages), the *SunSations* magazine, the Clubs and Groups Catalog, numerous PDFs in the Association Community Library, SCTV broadcasts, and the many emails that arrive throughout the month. Much of this information isn’t searchable or presented in a way that’s easy to explore.

There’s also a lot of valuable, practical knowledge that isn’t found in those official sources—things like trusted local recommendations, resident-suggested vendors, updates on municipal decisions, and plans for nearby development or road projects that affect Sun City. The idea behind SCHH Commons is simple: bring all of these pieces together in one friendly, easy-to-use place so residents can quickly find what they need.

The **SCHH Commons Knowledge Base** isn’t meant to replace official Sun City websites, association documents, or other authoritative sources. Those remain the final word for community rules, policies, and updates. Instead, the Commons serves as a helpful companion to those sources—an added layer that makes it easier to locate, connect, and understand information that matters to residents.

The **SCHH Commons Knowledge Base** and its **AI Assistant (chatbot)** were created to make that process even simpler. Just type a question—like you would when chatting with a friend—and the assistant provides clear, summarized answers drawn from a growing collection of trusted community sources.

The **[AI Assistant](/chatbot)** is powered by Notebook LM, an innovative AI tool developed by Google that transforms collections of documents into interactive, searchable notebooks. Notebook LM provides detailed, well-sourced responses and includes citations showing which documents were used in its answers.

To use the Assistant, simply open the Notebook LM link above. You’ll need to sign in with a Google account, and once inside, you can start exploring by asking questions in plain language.


The Knowledge Base currently includes most documents related to community governance and lifestyle. You can view the full list on the **[AI Assistant](/chatbot#knowledge-base)** page. Residents are encouraged to report any errors they find and to suggest—or even contribute—new information to keep the collection growing and accurate. Over time, it will expand to include more about the surrounding area, covering local services, attractions, and civic updates that matter to Sun City residents.

## Who I Am and Why I Started SCHH Commons

My name is Ron Snyder, and like many new residents, I spent my first few months here trying to figure out where to find things—who to ask, which website to visit, which document had the latest update. With my background in technology, research, and community projects, I soon discovered there was a chance to make this process easier for everyone.

I’m a veteran, having served ten years in the U.S. Air Force, followed by twenty years in the defense industry. After that, I spent nearly two decades in research and development in the non-profit academic world, leading AI and information projects that helped scholars and institutions share knowledge more effectively.

When I moved to Sun City Hilton Head, I noticed right away how these same skills could benefit our community—using technology to help residents connect with one another and with the information that matters most to daily life here. That’s how SCHH Commons began: a simple, resident-driven effort to make community knowledge easier to find, share, and use.

Today, the **Knowledge Base** and **AI Assistant** are at the heart of SCHH Commons, but they’re just the beginning. Other features are in development—like a consolidated events calendar, interactive maps, podcasts, and “Deep Dive” articles exploring topics of special interest to residents.

My hope is that SCHH Commons continues to grow as a shared community resource—built by residents, for residents.

## What is a “Commons”?

A **commons** is something shared and cared for by a community. In the past, it referred to open land—fields or pastures everyone could use. Today, the idea extends to shared knowledge, digital tools, and spaces where people collaborate for the common good.

**SCHH Commons** carries that spirit forward by gathering useful information, technology, and resources in one place—organized and shared for everyone’s benefit. It’s about making knowledge easier to reach and encouraging residents to help one another through shared experience and insight.

## Try It Out and Get Involved

Give it a try and see what you think! The AI Assistant is designed to be easy and safe to use—even if you’ve never used anything like it before. If you’ve tried ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot, the experience will feel familiar and friendly. Just type your question, and the chatbot will do its best to help.

You can start using the SCHH Commons AI Assistant today—it’s approachable, conversational, and always available to answer questions about Sun City Hilton Head. If you find it helpful, please consider **sharing feedback**, **suggesting improvements**, or **[supporting the site](/support)** so it can continue to grow.

Feedback and suggestions can be sent through the [Contact form](/contact) on the Commons website. And if you like what you see, please tell your neighbors and club members—the more people who use it, the better it becomes for everyone.

While the chatbots are designed to be intuitive, sometimes a quick demo helps. I’m happy to provide group presentations for clubs or neighborhood groups who want to learn more. To request one, just use the [Contact form](/contact) on the Commons website.

Here are a few sample prompts to try:

- “Brief me on recent community news and upcoming events.”
- “What’s happening this week in Sun City Hilton Head?”
- “Summarize the latest SunSations issue.”
- “What’s the process for submitting a modification request?”

### Support the Commons

SCHH Commons will always be free to use, but it does take resources to keep it running—hosting, AI services, and maintenance. If you find the site useful, please consider a [small donation](/support) to help cover these costs and keep the project growing. Your encouragement and support mean a lot and help keep this community effort moving forward.
