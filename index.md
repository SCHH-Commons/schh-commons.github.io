**SCHH Commons** is a resident-created resource that helps Sun City Hilton Head residents find and understand information more easily. It brings together official documents, local insights, and an AI-powered assistant that answers questions in plain language. In addition to the Knowledge Base and AI Assistant, the Commons also features other useful community resources—including an events calendar, interactive maps, podcasts, and in-depth “Deep Dive” articles exploring topics of special interest to residents.
