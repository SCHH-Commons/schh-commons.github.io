Sun City Hilton Head is a vibrant community filled with knowledge, creativity, and resources — but too often, that information is scattered across websites, PDF documents, emails, the monthly SunSations magazine, and even in conversations among neighbors. SCHH Commons was created to virtually bring these threads together, connecting them into a growing, easy-to-use knowledge base.

The initial focus of the Commons is on AI-assisted tools that make this knowledge base accessible in new ways. Instead of scrolling through multiple sites or digging through documents, you can ask questions, search across sources, and receive clear, conversational answers. The goal is not to replace official resources like the SCHH website, but to make them easier to navigate and connect with resident knowledge in ways that benefit everyone.

This initiative was started by me as a new resident who saw the potential for technology to make community life simpler and more connected. But the vision has always been broader: SCHH Commons is meant to become a community effort, shaped and enriched by the contributions of residents who want to share, curate, and expand the resources available here.

Looking ahead, SCHH Commons aims to evolve into a community resource hub, adding features like interactive maps, an events calendar, podcasts, and opportunities for residents to contribute their own insights. The Commons is meant to grow alongside the community, reflecting both the official and lived experiences of Sun City.

For now, think of SCHH Commons as an idea in motion — a seed planted with the hope that it can grow into something useful, collaborative, and uniquely Sun City. If you’re curious, try out the tools, explore the resources, and share your feedback. Together, we can build something that makes our community even stronger.
