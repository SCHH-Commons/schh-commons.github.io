# Exploring the SCHH Commons Knowledge Base  

One of the central features of SCHH Commons is the **Knowledge Base**—a growing collection of documents, guides, and resources that help residents and prospective residents better understand life in Sun City Hilton Head. The Knowledge Base brings together information from a variety of sources and makes it available through **AI-powered chatbots**, so you can ask questions and get clear, conversational answers.  

To make this resource as useful as possible, SCHH Commons currently offers **three different ways to interact with the Knowledge Base**:  

| Option       | Access Method | Login Required | Where It Runs | Best For |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Chatbase** | Embedded on Commons site | No | On the Commons website | Quick lookups, frictionless access |
| **Notebook LM** | Google’s Notebook LM | Yes (Google account) | New tab/window | In-depth research, responses with citations |
| **Custom GPT** | OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform | Yes (OpenAI/ChatGPT account) | New tab/window | Voice-enabled, natural conversation |

### Why Three Options?  
All three chatbots use the **same underlying Knowledge Base**, so the answers you receive should be broadly consistent. The reason for offering multiple options is that **different tools serve different needs**:  

- Chatbase emphasizes **easy, no-login access** directly within the Commons website.  
- Notebook LM is built for **research depth and citations** and runs in its own browser tab.  
- The Custom GPT adds a **voice-enabled, conversational dimension**, also in a separate tab.  

By providing these three entry points, SCHH Commons makes it easy for everyone—from casual users to serious researchers—to engage with the Knowledge Base in the way that best suits their needs.
